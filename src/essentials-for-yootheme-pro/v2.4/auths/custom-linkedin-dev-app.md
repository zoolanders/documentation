| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |

| *App logo* | The application logo, can be the company one. |
| *LinkedIn Page* | The associated LinkedIn Company Page URL, e.g. `https://www.linkedin.com/company`. |

::: tip Company Page
A LinkedIn App requires a LinkedIn Company Page to be associate with. Use your company's page or, if you're working for a client, their company page.

Don't have a company page yet? No problem! Simply [create one here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/).

## Verify Page Association

The organization that owns the page you have associated the app with function as the publisher of the app. The super admin must approve the association in the following 30 days. [Learn More](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a548360/).

Generate the URL and send it to the page super admin. An email will be sent whenever the association has been approved or denied. Wait for the approval before proceeding further.

## Request API Access

For the Essentials LinkedIn Source use case, you must request the `Advertising API` product. To do so go to *App Products* panel of the app and follow below steps.

## Generate a Token

Once the app is ready you can generate a token with it and use it for authentication.
