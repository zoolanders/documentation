## Content Preview of a Shared Url

When a URL is shared in a Social Media or App is totally up to the plaform if and how to extract the content preview from it, but luckily there are some standards. Most of platforms, including Facebok, relies on the Open Graph protocol, while Twitter has it own called Twitter Cards. Our recommendation is to support both.

1. First of all we need to retreieve the current page URL. Do so using the global _Request_ source part of Essentials Sources.
1. Then map it _Href_ property to the MailTo body field.
1. Further customizer thee body content using the _before_ and _after_ filters.
