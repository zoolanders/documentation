# Icon Collection

An icon collection represents a set of icons that can be added or removed collectively from the builder's icon library. You can install one of the collections provided by Essentials or [create a custom collection](./custom-collection).

After installation, the collection icons will integrate natively and be available in the builder Icon Picker under the _Collections_ Tab.
