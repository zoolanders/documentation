# My Icons

My Icons is a collection of custom curated icons set under the scope of a Child Theme. By placing the icons in the `{childtheme}/myicons` folder the icons of the currently active Child Theme seamlessly integrate into the icon library under the My Icons tab.

You can as well group them into subfolders, e.g. `{childtheme}/myicons/group-a`, `{childtheme}/myicons/group-b`.
