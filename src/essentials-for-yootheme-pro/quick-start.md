# Quick Start

Before diving into Essentials, make sure you have:

1. **YOOtheme Pro** installed and activated on your site
   - Not sure if you have it? Look for "YOOtheme" in your site's admin menu
   - Need YOOtheme Pro? Visit [yootheme.com](https://yootheme.com/page-builder)

2. **Basic familiarity** with YOOtheme Pro's Builder
   - Know how to add elements to a page
   - Understand what the Customizer is (the YOOtheme settings panel)
   - If not, review [YOOtheme Pro's official tutorials](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro) first

3. **A valid Essentials license** from ZOOlanders
   - You'll need this to download the plugin

## Understanding the Basics

### What is Essentials for YOOtheme Pro?

Think of Essentials as a "power-up pack" for YOOtheme Pro. It adds new capabilities that aren't included in the standard YOOtheme Pro installation, such as:

- **Connecting to external data** (like Instagram feeds, Google Sheets, databases)
- **Building advanced forms** (contact forms, surveys, registration forms)
- **Controlling who sees what** (show/hide content based on user type, device, date, etc.)
- **Adding more design options** (new icons, reusable layouts, custom elements)

### Key Terms You'll Encounter

Before we go further, let's clarify some terminology you'll see throughout the documentation:

- **Customizer**: The YOOtheme Pro settings panel where you configure themes and sites
- **Builder**: The visual page editor where you drag and drop elements to create layouts
- **Element**: A building block in the Builder (like a text box, image, or button)
- **Source**: A place where dynamic content comes from (like an Instagram feed or database)
- **Dynamic Content**: Content that changes automatically based on data from a source
- **Addon**: A feature module within Essentials (Forms, Dynamic Content, Access Conditions, etc.)

## Common Beginner Questions

### "I don't see Essentials in the Customizer"

- Make sure the plugin is enabled in your plugin manager
- Clear your site's cache
- Try refreshing the Customizer (close and reopen it)

### "The plugin won't install"

- Check that you meet the [system requirements](./#requirements)
- Verify you have YOOtheme Pro minimum required version installed
- Make sure your PHP version is higher than the minimum

### "My dynamic content isn't showing"

- Verify the source is configured correctly in the Sources manager
- Check that you've selected the source in the element's Advanced tab
- Make sure the source has data (e.g., the RSS feed is valid and accessible)
- Look for any error messages in the browser console

### "What's the difference between a Source and a Global Query?"

- A **Source** is a connection to data (like an RSS feed or database)
- A **Global Query** is a reusable query configuration that can be applied to multiple sources
- Start with Sources - you likely won't need Global Queries until you're doing more advanced work
