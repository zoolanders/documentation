## 2. Generate Access Token

Go to [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer). Select from the list of apps on the right the app you just created, and add the following permissions in the permissions list:

- instagram_basic
- pages_show_list
- pages_read_engagement
- pages_read_user_content
- business_management

Be sure that the list matches with the screenshot and _Generate Access Token_.

- When prompted login with the account that created the app itself.
- Select the business accounts (or all of them).
- Select the pages you want to give access to.
- Select the Instagram accounts you want to allow.
- Confirm.

::: tip Account Permissions
The Access Token should be generated with the account that created the app or at least one of the accounts listed in the app as _Testers_, _Developers_ or _Administrators_. If you donâ€™t do this, you will need to publish the app and get through the facebook review process (not recommended).

You now have an access token. Click on the Info icon and then on the _Open in Access Token Tool_.

Click on _Extend Access Token_ and copy the new Access Token. Use that token when authenticating a source with your custom app.

## 3. Authenticate a Source

Now that you have an access token create a Facebook or Instagram Business source. When authenticating choose _Custom App_, past the generated access token and complete the source setup.

::: tip Token Expiration
Note that the token will be auto-renewed by the source when used, but it may expire if not used enough during the given time period. If it does, you will need to generate a new token.
