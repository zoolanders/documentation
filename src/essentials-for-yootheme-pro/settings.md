## Advanced

Configure some advanced settings.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Addons* | Disable Essential addons individually. A disabled addon will be completely skipped from execution and is a good way to debug issues or to keep the global execution as smooth as possible. |
| *GeoIP Database Source* | The IP Geolocation database is required to localize the device IP geographically, used for example by the **Access IP Geolocation Rule**. If needed, follow the [GeoIP Database Installation](#geoip-database-installation). |
| *Import/Export* | Being Essentials Settings independent from the Theme, the only way to backup and/or restore is using the dedicated methods within _Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced_ panel. |
| *Debug Data* | If the support team requests it, here is where you can generate and download Debug Data information which includes a copy of the Theme Settings, Essentials Settings, Sources Schema, and the server configuration. As it might include sensitive data, be carefull who you share this with. |

## GeoIP Database

Geolocation rely on [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases)'s **GeoIP2** (commercial) or **GeoLite2** (free) Database. While the free version is enough for the majority of projects, the commercial one is claimed to be more accurate and frequently updated.

As per the license limitations, Essentials doesn't distribute either of them, if geolocation feature is required please proceed with the manual database installation.

### Installation {#geoip-database-installation}

Download the chosen Database from MaxMind, previous free registration is required, and upload it to any chosen folder of your web project server. Copy the relative path to the Database file, prepend it with `~/`, and past it into the _GeoIP Database Source_ setting at the _Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced_ panel, e.g. `~/geoip/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`.

Alternatively you can rely on 3rd party plugins for the installation and posterior updates of the Database. If opted this way, make sure the path to the Database is properly updated after installation.

::: tip Country or City Database
The **Country Database** allows resolving IP geolocation on the continent and country level, while the **City Database** allows the same plus cities and postal code levels. The City one might seems the obvious choice, but taking into consideration that its size is considerably bigger, choose it only when necessary.
