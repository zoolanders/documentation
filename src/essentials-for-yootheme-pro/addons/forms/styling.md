# Form Styling

Essentials relies on [UIkit Form Styles](https://getuikit.com/docs/form) to make your forms look great. This lets Essentials focus on creating solid HTML structures, while UIkit handles the visual part. To make things even better, YOOtheme Pro's builder has a handy [style customizer](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/style-customizer). With this tool, you can easily tweak how your forms look right in the customizer.

To change how your forms look, you have three options:

1. Use YOOtheme Pro's Style Customizer for overall form styling - This is the best way to make all your forms look the same across your site.
2. Check out UIkit's form component guide to find and use CSS classes and modifiers for more detailed control.
3. Write your own CSS using YOOtheme Pro's built-in CSS feature or in your child theme for complete control over every detail.

These options give you different levels of control and can be more or less complex. You can pick the one that works best for what you need and how much you know about CSS.

::: warning Notice
Be aware that certain form fields, such as Date inputs, are natively rendered by the browser. These fields may display their own icons and styles, which cannot be customized using standard methods. To modify the appearance of these, you'll need to apply browser-specific CSS styles tailored to your particular use case.
