# Form Area

::: warning This Page Has Moved
This documentation has been updated. Please refer to the [Form Element](./form-element) page instead. The Form Area is now a dedicated Form Element rather than a sublayout setting.

## Migration Notes

If you're looking for information about:

- **Creating forms**: Use the [Form Element](./form-element) from the Essentials group instead of enabling a sublayout as a form area
- **Honeypot protection**: This is now built into the [Form Element settings](./form-element#anti-spam-settings) rather than being a separate element
- **After Submit Actions**: Configure these in the [Form Element's Actions tab](./form-element#actions)
- **Form Hooks**: Set these in the [Form Element's Hooks tab](./form-element#hooks)
