# Element - Separator

The Separator element allows visually separating the elements into sections for better organization and management of the ZOO Admin View. It has a folding feature that will make it much easier to reach and edit any group of elements.

> This element is not compatible with submission nor any other frontend view.

If you wish to have some elements not grouped by the separator, be sure to place those before the first Separator element instance.
