# ZOO Lingual

After Essentials for ZOO installed, a new section under the namespace *zoolingual* will be available in the configuration of every element.

For elements with language specific content, like text or textarea, create as many copies as languages are in your site and specify to each one a language. Make sure to assign all of them to the same positions and customize the rendering if required.

For elements which values are universal, like numbers or dates, keep only one element and no languages assigned. On the layouts positions, though, assign the same element multiple times, one for each language, set the language and customize the rendering.

Repeat the process for each App and Type where translations are required.

::: warning
If the language settings are missing, make sure the *ZOO Lingual - Essentials* plugin is enabled.

## Translating

The language specific elements will have a language flag displayed, input the appropriate translation content the standard way. The name, alias, meta and others can be translated in the **Item Content Tab**.
