# F.A.Q

## Where can I set the list of available languages?

You can do so in *Extensions / Languages / Content Languages* tab.

## Does it translates Joomla! content?

No, ZOOlingual focus only on ZOO content and it is compatible with 3rd party language managers.

## Is a language switcher module provided?

No, ZOOlingual relies on the Joomla! inbuilt switcher or of a 3rd party language manager one.

## Does it supports category ordering by the translated name?

No, for all languages the items are sorted by the default language.

## Why an Item view is redirected to a Category view when switching language?

It's a limitation of the Joomla! language switcher. A possible solution is using a 3rd party language manager.

## Why when searching Items by name in a specific language it returns results from other languages?

It's a known limitation and currently there is no workaround.

## It is compatible with frontend editing?

It is not, the translations must be done in the backend.
