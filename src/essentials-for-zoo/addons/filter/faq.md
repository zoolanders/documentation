# F.A.Q.

## Is cross App/Type filtering supported?
No, ZOOfilter can only perform a filter on one App and Type at the same time. It is possible however to display several Modules with different configurations in the same page.

## Is global search supported?
No, ZOOfilter can only filter items by their elements values individually.

## How to enable UIkit layouts?
Set the *Page Layout* as `search_uikit` layout, *Result Layout* and *Module Layout* as UIkit in the ZOOfilter Module settings. To use UIkit layout for search form as well set *Search Form Style* as UIkit.

## How to make horizontal search form?
It is possible to set the Form Columns option in the ZOOfilter module settings (only when the *Search Form Style* and *Module Layout* is set to UIkit). To make the form horizontal set the value of the columns equal to the elements count.
