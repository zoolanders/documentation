# Separator Element

The **Separator Element** allows visually separating the elements into sections for better organization and management of the ZOO Admin View. It has a folding feature that will make it much easier to reach and edit any group of elements.

::: tip
If you wish to have some elements not grouped by the separator, be sure to place those before the first Separator element instance.
