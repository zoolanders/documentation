| _Editable_ | Determines if the element should allow make relations or only show them. Usually combined with Bi-relation feature. |
| _Authored by User_ | Limit the relations list to items authored by current User. |
| _Hide Unpublished_ | Limit the relations list to published items. |
| Items |
| _Apps_ | Limit the relations list to items belonging to selected Apps. |
| _Types_ | Limit the relations list to items being of selected Type. |
| _Bi-Related Elements_ | Choose the elements from other Types that will be used for the bi-directional relation. |

Bi-relation is a powerful feature, for example an _Event_ and _Venue_ items could be related to each other by saving only one of them, the other will be related to the first one automatically.

| _Link to Item_ | When **Related Layout** is set to **Item Name** allows linking the name to the Item full view. |

## Widgetkit Layout

Widgetkit layout is an integration layer between the element and [Widgetkit](http://yootheme.com/widgetkit) allowing to render a Widget using the element data as content. Therefore it is possible to render the related items data set in a Widgetkit widget. For details about configuration options visit the [Widgetkit documentation](https://yootheme.com/support/widgetkit/).
