# Upgrading Essentials for ZOO

This guide covers the upgrade process from ZOO 3 to ZOO 4 with Essentials for ZOO, including important considerations and step-by-step procedures.

## Overview

Upgrading from ZOO 3 to ZOO 4 with Essentials requires careful planning due to significant changes in the ecosystem. This process involves both upgrading the ZOO framework and transitioning to the new Essentials for ZOO 2 package.

## Pre-Upgrade Assessment

### Deprecated Extensions

The following ZOOlanders extensions are **no longer supported** in ZOO 4:

| Extension | Status | Replacement/Alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ZOOcart** | ❌ Deprecated | Consider alternative e-commerce solutions |
| **ZOOstats** | ❌ Deprecated | Use Google Analytics or similar |
| **ZOOorder** | ❌ Deprecated | Alternative ordering systems |
| **ZOOevents** | ❌ Deprecated | Event management extensions |
| **ZOOmailing** | ❌ Deprecated | Newsletter/mailing extensions |
| **ZOOcompare** | ❌ Deprecated | Product comparison alternatives |
| **ZOOlanders Component** | ❌ Deprecated | Functionality integrated into Essentials |

### Compatibility Check

Before proceeding, evaluate your site's dependencies:

1. **Essential Dependencies**
   ```
   ✓ Can you replace deprecated extensions?
   ✓ Are there suitable alternatives available?
   ✓ Will core functionality remain intact?
   ```

2. **Custom Development**
   ```
   ✓ Any custom code depending on deprecated extensions?
   ✓ Template modifications using deprecated features?
   ✓ Third-party integrations affected?
   ```

3. **Business Impact**
   ```
   ✓ Will e-commerce functionality be maintained?
   ✓ Can workflow continue during transition?
   ✓ Is downtime acceptable for migration?
   ```

::: warning Critical Decision Point
If your site heavily relies on deprecated extensions without suitable alternatives, consider staying on ZOO 3 until replacements are available.
