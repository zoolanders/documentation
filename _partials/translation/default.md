The ini files translations are managed by [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/joolanders/zoolanders/%1$s/) where you can get the latest versions and participate as translator. To install them in your site there are two ways:

## Manually

Download the translated file from Transifex and place it into **administrator/language/{LANG}** folder under the name **{LANG}.%2$s.ini**. E.g: **administrator/language/es-ES/es-ES.%2$s.ini**

>>>>> The default **en-GB.%2$s.ini** language file is located in the **administrator/language/en-GB** folder.

## Through ZOOlanders Manager

Access the **ZOOlanders Extensions Manager** and click on the **Language Packs** button to manage the available translations for all Extensions or the **Language** button on each extension row to manage them individually.
